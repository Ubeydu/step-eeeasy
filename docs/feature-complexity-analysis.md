# Feature Complexity Analysis

This document categorizes StepEeeasy features by implementation complexity.

---

## Relatively Complex Features

### 1. **History Screen - Weekly Bar Chart** (Most Complex)
**Why:**
- Custom chart visualization with interactive tap detection
- Week-by-week data aggregation logic
- Navigation state management (browsing between weeks)
- Tooltip/popover on bar tap with exact values
- Data calculation: aggregating multiple walks per day across a week
- Chart library integration and customization for mobile

### 2. **Paths Screen - Map Previews** (Complex)
**Why:**
- Map library integration (Google Maps SDK)
- Rendering multiple small map instances efficiently
- Storing and retrieving GPS coordinate arrays for each walk
- Drawing path polylines on each map thumbnail
- Performance considerations (lazy loading maps as user scrolls)
- Map initialization and cleanup in list items

### 3. **Home Screen - Real-time Walk Tracking** (Moderately Complex)
**Why:**
- Live step counting integration with device sensors
- Timer that runs continuously during active walk
- Real-time distance calculation from steps (stride-based)
- State management for Start/Stop with proper data persistence
- Background tracking considerations (keeping sensors active)
- Handling sensor permissions

## Simpler Features

- **Settings Screen** - Mostly straightforward UI with local storage
- **Tab Navigation** - Built-in Compose Navigation functionality
- **Paths List (without maps)** - Basic list rendering
- **Date/Time Display** - Simple formatting

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Start Simple:** Settings screen + basic tab navigation
2. **Core Feature:** Home screen with mock data (no sensors yet)
3. **Add Complexity:** Sensor integration for real tracking
4. **Data Visualization:** History screen with chart
5. **Final Touch:** Paths screen with map previews

## Implementation Strategy

- Build UI first with mock/hardcoded data
- Add data persistence layer
- Integrate device sensors and native features
- Optimize performance and add polish
