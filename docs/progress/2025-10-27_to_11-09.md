# Progress Log

### 2025-10-27 to 2025-11-09

- [2025-10-29] ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 3 Complete: Sensor Integration**
  - âœ… Created StrideCalculator utility for distance calculation
    - Formula: stride_length = height Ã— 0.43 / 100
    - Returns precise Double values for calculations
  - âœ… Created StepCounterManager for hardware step counter integration
    - Uses Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER (built-in hardware sensor)
    - Tracks baseline offset for delta calculation
    - Provides real-time step updates via callback
  - âœ… Updated HomeViewModel to integrate directly with StepCounterManager
    - Simplified approach: no foreground service (keeps it simple for high school project)
    - Steps only count when app is in foreground (acceptable trade-off)
    - Loads user height from settings for stride calculation
  - âœ… Implemented runtime permission flow in HomeScreen
    - Request ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION permission when user taps START
    - Shows rationale dialog if permission denied
    - Graceful handling with clear user messaging
  - âœ… Created FormatUtils for clean UI formatting
    - formatDistance(): 7.525 km â†’ "7.5 km"
    - formatDistanceFromMeters(): Shows "m" if <1000m, "km" otherwise
    - formatSteps(): Adds comma separators (10000 â†’ "10,000")
  - âœ… Updated AndroidManifest: Only ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION permission needed
    - Removed FOREGROUND_SERVICE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS (simplified)
  - âœ… Fixed compilation error: getUserHeight() â†’ userHeightCm (Flow property)
  - âœ… Built and installed APK on real device (Samsung Galaxy A34)
  - âœ… **Real Device Testing - All Core Features Working!**
    - âœ… Permission request flow works smoothly
    - âœ… Step counter tracks real steps accurately
    - âœ… Distance calculates correctly based on user height
    - âœ… Timer counts up properly (HH:MM:SS format)
    - âœ… Multiple walks can be recorded
    - âœ… Data persists to database correctly
  - ðŸ“‹ Discovered 5 UX issues during testing (non-critical):
    1. Height saved snackbar appears multiple times on navigation
    2. Snackbar blocked by keyboard (should move to top)
    3. Height input field shows saved value when clicked (confusing)
    4. Activity Recognition toggle doesn't sync with actual permission
    5. Activity Recognition toggle doesn't prevent step counting
  - âœ… Documented all UX issues in `docs/issues/ux-polish-issues.md`
    - Prioritized by severity (High/Medium/Low)
    - Included proposed solutions
    - Decision: Fix after Phase 4 is complete
  - âœ… Researched Phase 4 requirements (History Screen)
    - Verified database layer is ready (WalkDao.getAllWalks exists)
    - Confirmed repository layer is complete
    - Identified 4 files to create + 1 to modify
  - âœ… Created detailed implementation plan: `docs/implementationPlans/phase4-history-screen.md`
    - Step-by-step guide with full code snippets
    - Testing checklist included
    - Ready to implement next session
