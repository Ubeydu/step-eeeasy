# Progress Log

### 2025-10-13 to 2025-10-19

- [2025-10-18] ✓ Reviewed project documentation (app-main-features-v1.md, android-development-plan-v1.md)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Reviewed UI wireframes (Home, History, Paths, Settings screens)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Analyzed current project structure (Jetpack Compose with Material 3)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Added Room database dependencies to gradle/libs.versions.toml (v2.6.1)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Added Hilt dependency injection dependencies to gradle/libs.versions.toml (v2.51.1)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Added KSP plugin dependencies to gradle/libs.versions.toml (v2.0.21-1.0.25)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Applied Room and Hilt plugins to app/build.gradle.kts
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Added Room implementation dependencies (runtime, ktx, compiler)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Added Hilt implementation dependencies (android, compiler)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Verified Gradle configuration with `./gradlew tasks` (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Created domain model package structure (com.example.stepeeeasy.domain.model)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Created GpsPoint.kt domain model (latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp, accuracy)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Created Walk.kt domain model (with computed properties: durationSeconds, distanceKm)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Created DailyStats.kt domain model (daily aggregation with totalDistanceKm)
- [2025-10-18] ✓ Verified Kotlin compilation with `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- [2025-10-22] 📋 **Design Decision**: Removed PAUSE functionality from MVP (START/STOP only)
  - Wireframe shows PAUSE button, but architecture plan marks it as "advanced feature"
  - Keeping it simple: walks can only be started and stopped (not paused/resumed)
  - Can be added later as enhancement if needed
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Removed elevation/altitude tracking from all domain models
  - Removed `altitude` from GpsPoint.kt
  - Removed `elevationGainMeters` from Walk.kt
  - Removed `totalElevationGainMeters` from DailyStats.kt
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Removed elevation/altitude from documentation files
  - Updated app-main-features-v1.md
  - Updated android-development-plan-v1.md
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Created Room entity package structure (data.local.entity)
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Created WalkEntity.kt (database table for walks, no elevation field)
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Created GpsPointEntity.kt (database table for GPS points, no altitude field)
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Verified Room entities compile correctly (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- [2025-10-22] 📋 **Design Decision**: DailyStats uses DTO pattern (no @Entity table)
  - DailyStats is aggregated data, not stored as separate table
  - Query walks table with SQL aggregation (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY)
  - Follows Clean Architecture with proper layer separation
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Created data/local/model package for DTOs
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Created DailyStatsDto.kt (data class for SQL query results, not @Entity)
- [2025-10-22] ✓ Verified all changes compile correctly (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Created WalkDao with CRUD operations and daily stats aggregation
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Created GpsPointDao for GPS point management
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Created AppDatabase with Room configuration
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Set up Hilt (StepEeeasyApplication + DatabaseModule)
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Added walk_id index to GpsPointEntity for query performance
- [2025-10-23] ✓ Updated AndroidManifest for Hilt configuration

### Next
- Create WalkRepository implementation
- Create use cases (StartWalkUseCase, StopWalkUseCase)
- Build HomeViewModel
- Build Home screen UI (Compose)

---

### 📍 Session Resume Guide
**Progress:** Phase 1 (~40% complete) - Database layer complete, Hilt configured
**Read:** `docs/android-development-plan.md` Phase 1 tasks 3-6
**Immediate next:** WalkRepository → Use Cases → HomeViewModel → Home screen UI
**Key decisions:** No PAUSE button, no elevation tracking, DailyStats uses DTO pattern, using Compose (not XML)
