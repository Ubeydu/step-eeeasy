# StepEasy - App Overview

StepEasy is an offline-first mobile walking tracker that records individual walks with real-time step counting, distance, and elevation tracking. Users manually start, pause, and stop walk sessions from the Home screen, while the History screen aggregates all walks into a weekly bar chart view. The app includes a visual Paths screen showing map previews of recorded routes, and a Settings screen for configuring height-based stride estimation and sensor permissions. All data is stored locally on the device, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.
